"""Your argument is completely flawed and shows a lack of understanding of the issue at hand. It's clear that you haven't done your research, and you're just spouting off nonsense to try and make yourself look smart. Your ideas are dangerous and harmful, and you should be ashamed of yourself for promoting them.""",1

"""Your opinions are so outdated and backward that it's almost comical. You're clearly stuck in the past and can't handle the fact that the world is changing around you. You're holding us all back with your regressive ideas, and it's time for you to step aside and let progress happen.""",1
"""You're a terrible person, plain and simple. Your views are hateful and bigoted, and you should be ashamed of yourself for promoting them.

"""You are such a self-absorbed and egotistical person. All you care about is yourself and your own success. You have no empathy for others and you always try to undermine everyone else to get ahead. Your arrogance is truly astounding, and I'm sick of having to deal with your toxic behavior. You need to take a long hard look in the mirror and start making some serious changes if you want to be a decent human being.""",1
"""Your work is subpar at best. You consistently fail to meet the most basic standards of quality, and you seem to have no desire to improve. It's clear that you have no respect for this company or your colleagues, and you are content to coast along doing the bare minimum. You are a liability to this organization, and it's only a matter of time before you are replaced by someone who actually cares about their work.""",1

"""You are a toxic and divisive influence on this team. You create drama and conflict wherever you go, and you seem to enjoy stirring the pot just to see what happens. You have no respect for other people's opinions, and you always try to dominate every conversation. It's clear that you have no interest in working together or building a positive team dynamic. I don't know how much longer we can tolerate your presence.""",1
"""You are such a hypocrite. You go around preaching about morality and ethics, but behind closed doors you engage in all sorts of unethical and immoral behavior. You are a liar and a cheat, and you have no qualms about throwing anyone under the bus if it means advancing your own interests. You are a disgrace to this company and to humanity in general. I can't believe we are forced to work with someone like you.""",1
